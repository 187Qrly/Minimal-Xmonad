# Minimal-Xmonad
Minimal Xmonad configuration without xmobar. This repo contains a bunch of gtk themes, themes for icons and mouse cursor theme. This config works with xmonad version 0.14.
Dependencies:
Must have:
'xdotool' (for clickable workspaces in xmobar)

All Xmonad configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs. This includes things like key bindings, colors, layouts, etc. You may need to have some basic understanding of Haskell in order to modify this file, but most people have no problems. Configuration file for xmobar is ~/.xmobarrs. Xmobar is configured to show date and time, cpu usage, disk usage (root dir), net activity, mpd info (curent playing song). This comes with nice bars (thanks for xmobar developer).
